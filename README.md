## Installation
1. Clone the repo to your computer by clicking the green code button and copying the SSH version or clicking the blue use template button.

2. Open Gitbash in your desired folder and type ```git clone ``` then right click to paste the string and hit enter. The repo will then be cloned to your computer.

3. Navigate to the repo folder and type ```code .``` into gitbash to open the repo in VS Code.

4. Open a new Terminal in VS Code and type ```npm install``` to install the repo dependencies.

5. Finally, type ```npm run start``` into the terminal and it will start the dev server.

Note: To make a static no backend React site work on Heroku you need to take all the files out of the folder name you specified in the react-create-app. E.g. if you did create-react-app client, React will create the app in a folder called client, take all the files out of the client folder so they are now all at root level and then delete the empty client folder.
